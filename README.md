## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility Aware

### What I learned

This project had a good challenge to arrange the svg's. So I tried to apply a style for a watch too, just to get some more experience.

I got caught out with the box svg in the desktop style. The other two images need to have overflow hidden, but the box needed to overflow. I made life a little more difficult by not using the first two as background images and then letting the box overflow. But I hacked my way through it, though I won't make that mistake again.

### Continued development

I played a lot with transform and translate on this project. Positioning outside of basic html, grid, and flexbox is a weakness. I made a lot of progess with those skills on this project, but will continue to learn more of the tricks that will save a lot of time in the future.
